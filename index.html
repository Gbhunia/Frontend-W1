        ​36 year old Rukmini and 34 year old Omana  are mothers to 3 children each, who are all malnourished. As a matter of fact, Rukmini and Omana are themselves underweight. They do not have the government provided ration cards as they are unaware of the procedures to procure one. Lack of education and awareness continues to take a heavy toll on such families. They are just one among the many such families. They need constant assistance and support to lift them and their children from the ongoing cycle of poor education, malnutrition and poverty.

        Much has changed since 1974, when FAO first began reporting on the extent of hunger in the world. The world population is growing steadily and is increasingly urbanized. Technology is evolving incessantly and the economy is more and more globalized. At the same time, there are worrying global trends in malnutrition, including a rapid rise in overweight and obesity, even as forms of undernutrition persist. The way food is produced, distributed and consumed worldwide has also changed dramatically. This vastly different world calls for new ways of thinking about hunger and food insecurity.

As part of its mandate, FAO strives to eradicate hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition. Supporting the livelihoods of small-scale food producers, improving the resilience of food production systems and encouraging the sustainable use of natural resources are all key to fulfilling this mandate and achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2), a world without hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition.
